Cheek Bistro,0,Three years one Michelin star and plenty of other accolades later Cheek by Jowl has run its last service. Thankfully its replacement doesn't fall too far from what chef Rishi Naleendra initially set out to achieve. We might even like Cheek Bistro more than the original. The update is warmer and more convivial than its predecessor with a fresh coat of paint indoor plants and art by the multi-talented chef adorning its walls. Its la carte-only menu is unfussy and retains some Cheek by Jowl favourites so you can put down your pitchfork and breathe easy. Try the oysters topped with smoked tomato granita ($6) but the new waffle with chicken liver parfait ($6) is a real showstopper. For larger sharing plates we recommend the burrata and heirloom tomatoes ($22) and unctuous lamb ribs ($28) with a smoky eggplant pure.,oysters topped original walls breathe easy smoked tomato granita ($ 6 thankfully update jowl favourites run convivial multi paint indoor plants smoky eggplant pure three years one michelin star achieve new waffle predecessor burrata art fresh coat warmer chicken liver parfait unfussy real showstopper cheek pitchfork put menu chef rishi naleendra initially set unctuous lamb ribs 28 try recommend plenty far might even like bistro larger sharing plates talented adorning heirloom tomatoes 22 fall accolades later replacement last service retains la carte,2
