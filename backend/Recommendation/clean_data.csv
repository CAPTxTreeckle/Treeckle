1,1,qwe321,The ABC Sunday Night Movie is a television program that aired on Sunday nights first for a brief time in 1962 under the title Hollywood Special (although Time magazine lists this version as The Sunday Night Movie) to supposedly replace an open time slot for the TV show Bus Stop which was cancelled after March 1962. It then began airing regularly under its more commonly known title from late 1964 to 1998 on ABC. Since 2004 it has aired sporadically as a special program now titled the ABC Sunday Movie of the Week though as of the 2011-12 television season the only films in this timeslot were aired under the Hallmark Hall of Fame banner which transferred to ABC in that season. However in 2014 The Hallmark Hall of Fame moved exclusively to cable on the Hallmark Channel. As a result of this the Sunday Night Movie is now exclusively relegated to two special holiday movies The Sound of Music every holiday season and The Ten Commandments every Easter.The ABC Sunday Night Movie was replaced in 1998 with The Wonderful World of Disney although the Sunday Night Movie initially continued to air alongside TWWOD for its final season.,,hallmark hall fame moved exclusively 1998 2014 final season channel replaced television program 2011 abc sunday movie special supposedly replace wonderful world disney although night open time slot two holiday movies initially continued relegated sound cancelled 12 began airing regularly version transferred tv show bus stop nights first aired sporadically 1962 however air alongside twwod since 2004 banner music every titled brief ten commandments easter films late 1964 march week though commonly known title cable timeslot result hollywood magazine lists
2,2,qwv321,Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of Hallows' Even or Hallows' Evening) also known as Allhalloween All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve is a celebration observed in several countries on 31 October the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead including saints (hallows) martyrs and all the faithful departed.It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain that such festivals may have had pagan roots and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church. Some believe however that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday separate from ancient festivals like Samhain.Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling) attending Halloween costume parties carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns lighting bonfires apple bobbing divination games playing pranks visiting haunted attractions telling scary stories as well as watching horror films. In many parts of the world the Christian religious observances of All Hallows' Eve including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead remain popular although elsewhere it is a more commercial and secular celebration. Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day including apples potato pancakes and soul cakes.,,celebration observed contraction western christian feast even ancient festivals like samhain certain vegetarian foods attending halloween costume parties carving pumpkins dead including saints graves meat gaelic festival world pagan roots hallowe begins en liturgical year dedicated believe however began solely '- lanterns lighting bonfires apple bobbing divination games playing pranks visiting haunted attractions telling scary stories three eve church services several countries commercial hallows celtic harvest particularly widely believed day observance secular candles religious observances may activities include trick allhalloween christianized faithful departed tradition reflected holiday separate evening martyrs many traditions originated eating time early treating 31 october souling well christians historically abstained remembering remain popular although elsewhere soul cakes watching horror films also known related guising jack vigil apples potato pancakes allhallowtide parts
3,3,awv321,Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking where one foot is always in contact with the ground the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A characteristic feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago probably in order to hunt animals. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.,,competitive running grew always legs feet ability various areas 632 bce spring exceptions ). method assumed long distances center 6 million years ago probably described energy storage accomplished world changes aerial phase order viewpoint contact sprinting hunt animals contrast body passive muscle elasticity racing date back type stride occur simultaneously gravity vaults springy tendons religious festivals accessible sport kinetic walking 1171 move rapidly humankind developed stance leg mass mechanics ground term tailteann games refer gait characterized kept mostly straight 2 foot terrestrial locomotion allowing humans inverted pendulum fashion ancestors potential within records speeds ranging variety run though jogging characteristic feature ireland first recorded olympic took place 776 one

6,6,gfq321,"Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term poiesis ""making"") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics sound symbolism and metreto evoke meanings in addition to or in place of the prosaic ostensible meaning.Poetry has a very long history dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting poetry in Africa and panegyric and elegiac court poetry was developed extensively throughout the history of the empires of the Nile Niger and Volta river valleys. Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa can be found among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE while the Epic of Sundiata is one of the most well-known examples of griot court poetry. The earliest Western Asian epic poetry the Epic of Gilgamesh was written in Sumerian. Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing or from a need to retell oral epics as with the Sanskrit Vedas Zoroastrian Gathas and the Homeric epics the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry such as Aristotle's Poetics focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric drama song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition verse form and rhyme and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively informative prosaic forms of writing.Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance alliteration onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity symbolism irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate imagesa layering of meanings forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist between individual verses in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.Some poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante Goethe Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter there are however traditions such as Biblical poetry that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition playing with and testing among other things the principle of euphony itself sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world poets often adapt forms styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.",,"biblical poetry uses chinese shijing incantatory effects metaphor simile particular cultures rhythmic qualities today known examples 25th century bce means written nile niger greek term poiesis meanings forming connections previously aesthetics objectively informative prosaic forms emphasized later attempts concentrated use readers accustomed similarly figures resonance may exist well repetition verse form earliest western asian epic panegyric languagesuch retell oral epics perceived respond multiple interpretations empires pyramid texts euphony phonaesthetics sound symbolism elegiac court achieve musical things africa prehistorical times otherwise disparate imagesa layering sumerian sundiata folk songs diverse poetics focused eurasian continent evolved comedy techniques create rhythm derives language need aesthetic sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme rumi think words sanskrit vedas zoroastrian gathas types metreto evoke devices emotive responses ancient writing languages long history dating back critique place aristotle suggest differential interpretation kindred poem open patterns specific griot found among ostensible meaning set creation lines based testing dante goethe mickiewicz gilgamesh iliad characteristics literature speech features addition define poet writes one variant distinguish ambiguity irony genres increasingly globalized world poets often adapt styles making "") identifying hunting developed extensively throughout poetic diction leaves used odyssey much modern reflects stylistic elements however traditions regular meter rhetoric drama song individual verses principle early poems tradition playing volta river valleys metonymy assonance alliteration onomatopoeia homeric conventions"
