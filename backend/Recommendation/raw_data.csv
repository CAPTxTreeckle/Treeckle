                Jam at Siri House
            ",0,"<p>Ever wondered what it'd be like to dine in a luxurious condo owned by Bangkok's super-rich? Jam at Siri House gives you a taste of that experience – all without leaving Singapore. The 42-seat restaurant is an intimate space that houses an eclectic range of furniture from mid-century antiques and dazzling chandeliers to plush lounge sets dressed in bright handwoven Jim Thompson silks. Settle into one of its many velvet-draped seats and expect to be blown away by food that escapes narrow definition. The food at Jam at Siri House is playful, fun to eat and outrageously delicious. The spicy potatoes ($16) are Hasselback potatoes covered in mala mayo, crispy beef lardons and parmesan; the pappardelle ($33) utilises prawn and lobster heads to make an intoxicating bisque-like sauce that's tossed in freshly made pasta and finished with smoked mussels and a roasted tiger prawn; and the cod ($38) is a novel take on traditional Chinese steamed fish.</p>"

                Bar Cicheti
            ",0,"<p>Can a Singaporean chef – who's never even stepped foot in Italy, we might add – make pasta better than the Italians? At Bar Cicheti on Jiak Chuan Road, the answer is yes. The mostly handmade pastas are done fresh by Aun and his team at Bar Cicheti's open kitchen. On its spring menu are creations like the bucatini ($30) a thick and hollow noodle soaks up the fragrant saffron broth it's cooked in and finished with spring peas, seared Hokkaido scallops and citron zest. Another winner is Aun's take on classic Italian pesto: spaghetti ($28) is tossed in a blend of jalapenos and basil before it's twirled together with pistachios, pine nuts and ricotta salata. The small plates are not to be missed too. Lingua di Manzo Tonnato ($18), or braised beef tongue, makes an offal eater out of any non-believer.</p>"

                Cheek Bistro
            ",0,"<p>Three years, one Michelin star and plenty of other accolades later, Cheek by Jowl has run its last service. Thankfully, its replacement doesn't fall too far from what chef Rishi Naleendra initially set out to achieve. We might even like Cheek Bistro more than the original. The update is warmer and more convivial than its predecessor, with a fresh coat of paint, indoor plants and art by the multi-talented chef adorning its walls. Its à la carte-only menu is unfussy and retains some Cheek by Jowl favourites so you can put down your pitchfork and breathe easy. Try the oysters topped with smoked tomato granita ($6) but the new waffle with chicken liver parfait ($6) is a real showstopper. For larger sharing plates, we recommend the burrata and heirloom tomatoes ($22) and unctuous lamb ribs ($28) with a smoky eggplant purée.</p><p> </p>"

                Restaurant Zén
            ",0,"<p>Priced at $450 for dinner, Zén is one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore. But look beyond the eye-watering price tag at chef Björn Frantzén first international outpost and you'll find that a meal here is well worth it. Your dinner starts out on the first floor of the three-storey shophouse along trendy Bukit Pasoh with snacks that have been perfected in the kitchen of Sweden’s first three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Before you proceed to dig into your mains on the second floor, you're presented with a table of ingredients that you'd be hard pressed to find in any other restaurant in the city – or the region. They go towards making stunning plates like beautifully cooked marron interjected with puffed Koshihikari rice, Yukimuro snow-aged wagyu covered with ramson, pickled baby pine cones flown in from Russia and the most incredibly balanced dessert of sea buckthorn sorbet served paired with oolong mousse and match meringue.</p>"

                New Ubin Zhongshan Park
            ",0,"<p>Opening its third outlet on the island and first hotel restaurant, New Ubin Group is quickly solidifying itself as Singapore's zi char king. It's built a reputation of serving hearty local favourites as well as some unexpected creations you wouldn't usually find at your typical heartland joint. Its most famous dish is the USDA Black Angus ‘Choice’ Rib-Eye (from $80/500g) served medium-rare with caramelised onions, potato wedges and various sauces but you definitely need to have it with New Ubin's signature Heart Attack Fried Rice, which is fried with beef drippings. Aside from its star creation, other must-tries include the Foie Gras Egg Special ($10.50), pan-seared foie gras served with soft boiled eggs sprinkled with truffle salt; mud crabs (from $48/400g) baked with copious amounts of garlic; as well as the Boss Bee Hoon ($12), a wok hei bomb of just three simple ingredients: rice vermicelli, egg and chye sim.</p>"

                Basque Kitchen by Aitor
            ",0,"<p>Following his departure from one-Michelin-starred Iggy’s at the Hilton Singapore, chef Aitor Jeronimo Orive has teamed up with powerhouse hotel and restaurant group Unlisted Collection to open Basque Kitchen. Inspired by the cuisine of Basque Country, where meats are grilled over hot coals and stews are rustic and hearty – he elevates these homey dishes with techniques he’s learnt cooking at some of the top restaurants in the world. Lunch is priced from $38 while dinner starts from $85 but we highly recommend the grill tasting menu ($98) that highlights dishes that are cooked on a Josper-made Basque grill. The menu features Kokotxas, a traditional dish of desalted cod chin that's slathered in pil-pil, a rich sauce made with olive oil, back garlic and guindillas (small hot peppers) as well as the Txuleta, a showstopping grilled Angus prime rib showered with black truffle. This isn't your ordinary steak, chef Aitor specifically uses old cows that can be up to 18 years of age, which results in a flavourful, albeit slightly less tender.</p>"

                Min Jiang at Dempsey
            ",0,"<p>First opened in 1982 at Goodwood Park Hotel, Min Jiang has long been a stalwart of Chinese cuisine in Singapore. And after 12 years at Rochester Park, the brand's second outlet has moved to bigger space on Dempsey Hill decked out in rustic touches made modern like weaved wooden panels, rattan chairs and large drop lanterns that emit a warm glow over the dining room. Helming the restaurant is chef Goh Chee Kong, who's spent the past 32 years cooking at Min Jiang. He specialises in both Cantonese and Sichuan cuisine, producing beautiful plates of dim sum – the steamed Goldfish prawn dumpling ($4.80) is extremely Instagrammable, as is the pretty deluxe platter ($38) of blue pea truffle vegetable dumpling, steamed crabmeat, prawn and vegetable dumpling, fried glutinous rice golden pumpkin, and scallop dumpling. Other highlights on the menu include the braised sea treasure soup in pomegranate egg white parcel ($48), where Australian abalone, bamboo pith and dried scallops are poached and wrapped in an egg white skin. There's also the legendary wood-fired Beijing Duck ($118/ordering one day in advance is recommended) carved tableside with eight different condiments.</p>"

Chef-owner Shigeru Koizumi prepares Kappo-style cuisine with utmost precision, bringing together his experience cooking at three-Michelin-starred Nihonryori Ryugin in Tokyo and Singapore’s very own two-Michelin-starred Odette. The menu changes almost every week, following the micro-seasonality of ingredients, so you never really know what you’re going to get. The only choice you get to make is if you want the seven-course ($198), nine-course ($258) or the more premium and customisable chef’s menu ($308) and if you’d like to pair your meal with alcohol ($78/$108) or house-blended teas ($38/$48).</p>"

After three years helming the restaurant, chef Kirk Westaway has hit full stride with his latest Reinventing British menu. A series of snacks like a fish and chips tart and Britain’s national dish, chicken tikka masala served to the tune of Brit-pop and rock music to set the tone of the meal. Signature mains include the Alaskan langoustine served with courgette as well as aged roasted pigeon with blackberry, beetroot and foie gras.</p>"

Opt for Lee’s ‘ahmakase’ menu ($65/lunch, $88/dinner) if you're new the cuisine and unsure of where to start. But the brave should not miss buah keluak ($22) of braised local chicken – it's an acquired taste but you haven't really had Peranakan food if you don't give it a try.</p>"

There’s just something incredibly honest about a solid slab of meat coaxed over open flames. The steak topped with bone marrow and burnt onion is something you'll find on every table, but to leave without chowing down on Burnt End's legendary sanger burger would be a travesty.</p>"

The two-Michelin-star holder is really pushing Singapore's culinary landscape forwards with its Essential Cuisine philosophy.  Described as honest food with a steep respect for ingredients cultivated from his farming family in France, chef Julien Royer’s cuisine prides itself on keeping up with the provenance of its produce, which results in magnificent plates that will blow any diner away.</p>"

Inspired by the laid-back teahouses of Chengdu, the restaurant tastefully makes use of lush greenery and eclectic design pieces to create a space you won't mind unwinding at from morning 'til late. Try the roasted chicken and avocado salad with Sichuan pepper, oriental bolognaise and hot and sour chazuke, a light and mildly spicy broth that's poured over a bed of Niigata rice and charcoal-grilled barramundi. </p>"

Gather around the communal tables at the brands biggest outlet to date and make your own Nyonya Poh Piah ($58). Each platter comes with 12 different toppings including steamed prawns, Chinese sausage and braised bamboo shoots and jimaca, or as it's known here in Singapore, bung kuang. There are six skins you can gussy a roll up to your liking – figuring out how much you can stuff in there without breaking the skin is half the fun. Eating it like a burrito is the other half. Other Jewel exclusives include the Roti Violet Tuna Wala-Wala ($15) – think of it as a roti prata soft taco topped with flaky tuna tossed in spices – and the otak toast ($16), thick, spicy mackerel fish cake served on toast. Violet's signatures like the beef rendang ($23), dry laksa ($24) and ngoh hiang ($14) are also on the menu.</p>"

The nasi lemak at The Coconut Club is a faultless example of the classic Malay dish. You get a fried egg, ikan bilis, peanuts, slices of Japanese cucumber, two juicy pieces of fried chicken, sambal and unlimited servings of rice flavoured with coconut milk from a single plantation in Sabak Bernam, Malaysia.</p>"

Chef Damian D'Silva is a veteran chef that's fiercely protecting the Eurasian and Peranakan dishes he grew up. These dishes are painstakingly made from scratch the old-fashioned way.

Start your meal with plump Canadian oysters topped with rasam granita ($28/5 pieces) and spiced potato chips ($10). The star of the show is the pork ribs glazed with medjool dates ($35) best served with a plate of berry pulao ($12).

            ",0,"<p>Think of Maggie Joan's as a hipper-than-thou secret dining club hiding behind a rusty door marked by an unlit signboard along Gemmill Lane. The restaurant is the sibling of Moosehead Kitchen and Bar and father-and-son team Glen and Daniel Ballis have decided to move head chef Seumas Smith over to take over Maggie Joan's open kitchen. 
The long, dark and cavernous dining room makes this restaurant a sexy spot for a date – if only because the seductive dishes match the drapes. The seasonally driven plates are refined yet hearty best exemplified by the likes of burrata paired with peas and preserved lemon ($21) and roasted carrots paired with ricotta, apricot and rosemary ($10). Mains are more than substantial, with options such as thick cuts of pan-seared barramundi ($34) cooked with sustainably farmed mussels and nage as well as spiced lamb with salmorejo ($44), black garlic and salsa verde. 
Even if we're not in the mood for a full meal, we can see ourselves popping in for a drink, some tapas and maybe even lunch just to soak in the atmosphere. The ‘appetisers’ – they’re snacks, really – make good padding for drinks: try the shiso tempura topped with taramasalata ($3) and the excellent house-baked sourdough with smoked beef fat butter ($4).</p>"

It appears simple enough, but the pancake-resembling seafood noodle dish is the joint’s star. Charred and crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, each strand of bee hoon is coated with a smoky wok hei. JB Ah Meng also does a killer rendition of white pepper crab (from $24) – the dish is only mildly spicy and lets the natural sweetness of the crustacean shine. </p>"

Jumbo’s been serving chilli crabs at its birthplace, East Coast Park, since 1987 and has long been a favourite of many.

Chef Seita regularly travels to Japan to source for new ingredients, establishing close relationships with his suppliers to get the best quality of ingredients which he uses in omakase sets ($168/$208/$308) that change seasonally. Lunch is also available from $48.</p>"

                Restaurant Ibid
            ",0,"<p>It’s been three years since Woo Wai Leong won the first MasterChef Asia and he's finally opened his own restaurant. Restaurant Ibid’s story first starts with its name. It’s meant to highlight Leong’s roots as a Singaporean Chinese man and his Nanyang identity – a phrase borrowed from the realm of art where Singaporean painters like Liu Kang and Georgette Chen blended Western and Eastern painting traditions. Priced at $78 for four courses, $88 for six and $118 for eight, the dinner highlights playful twists on childhood favourites with touches influenced by traditional Chinese medicine.</p>"

                Fat Prince
            ",0,"<p>Let Fat Prince show you a whole new world of Middle Eastern flavours, shining, shimmering and splendid. Designed to reflect Istanbul’s opulent café culture – think velvet navy chairs and Arabic mosaic embedded in its walls – it’s grand without being gaudy. The restaurant focuses on kebabs. There are currently six types on the menu, including baharat honey chicken, smoked kasar cheese and spicy beef Adana.</p>"

                Salted and Hung
            ",0,"<p>Curing, smoking and fermenting are front and centre of this Drew Nocente-led kitchen. That much is clear as soon as you step into the long shophouse space, see the little piggies on the walls and pass a dry cabinet in which all manner of salami and steaks hang, their hues ranging from deep mahogany to pale pink. There’s even kangaroo loin, a nod to Nocente’s Aussie roots, lurking in there.</p>"

                Humpback
            ",0,"<p>It might not live by the sea, but this beach shack along Bukit Pasoh Road is all about the goodness of the ocean. Slurp down fresh oysters – there are always at least three types available and if you come from 5pm to 8pm they're only $3 a pop – or tuck into plates of prawns, salmon, clams, scallops, octopus, lobster... the list goes on. There are plenty of greens to go around too.</p>"

                Skai
            ",0,"<p>Perched on the 70th floor of the Swissotel the Stamford, Skai overlooks the civic district down from the Padang to Marina Bay. Start your meal with a series of sharing plates. The heirloom tomatoes ($22) and yellowfin tuna tartare ($24) are safe favourites. Executive chef Paul Hallett is also an expert butcher and self-professed lover of steak, so it’s no surprise to see 10 types of rare beef like the Saga Wagyu tenderloin ($170) on offer.</p>"
